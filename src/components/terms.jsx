            between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”)
            and GrocerE (“we,” “us” or “our”), concerning your access to and use

            form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related,
            linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”).
            You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and
            agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. If you do not agree
            with all of these Terms of Use, then you are expressly prohibited
            from using the Site and you must discontinue use immediately.
            Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on
            the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein
            by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make
            changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for
            any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the
            “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right
            to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your
            responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay
            informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to
            have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any

            Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other
            locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible
